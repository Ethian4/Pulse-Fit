The Pulse Fit project focuses on developing an innovative digital platform, a 
progressive web application designed to tackle the challenges of modern 
work-life balance by streamlining gym membership management. In todayâ€™s 
fast-paced society, time constraints often disrupt work-life harmony, leaving 
little room for fitness. Pulse Fit aims to address this by offering a flexible 
solution: an app that integrates local gym memberships, enabling users to 
access any gym in the network at their preferred time. This flexibility eliminates 
the need to frequent the same gym during peak hours, enhancing 
convenience and adaptability to individual schedules. 
The platform is accessible on both mobile and desktop devices, connecting 
users to a network of local gyms and offering comprehensive features such as 
gym discovery, class bookings, workout tracking, progress monitoring, and 
f
 lexible payment options. Its goal is to provide a user-friendly, seamless solution 
that enhances convenience and promotes well-being.
